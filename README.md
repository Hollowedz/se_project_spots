# Project 3: Spots

A website where you post and share photos on your profile. 

## Description

A basic but yet interactive profile of a Aviator named Bessie Coleman and photos of everywhere she loved to visit/fly. This webpage was built with a responsive design of most screen resolutions but focused on 1440 desktop view and 627 mobile view resolutions. The buttons have simple but elegant hover effects that enhance this simple webpage layout. The cards were built with grid instead of flexbox partly to enhance the responsiveness of the page and I wanted to see the differences between the two display inputs.
